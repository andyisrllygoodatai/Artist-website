<h1>Kali uchis</h1>
    <h2>By:Lucas and Andres</h2>
<p>Karly-Marina Loaiza (born July 17, 1994 in Alexandria, VA, U.S.), professionally known as Kali Uchis, is a Colombian-American singer-songwriter, record producer and music video director. She writes and produces most of her own music.The stylistic range of left-field pop artist Kali Uchis is reflected in the variety of her collaborators — an extensive genre-crossing list that includes Tyler, the Creator, Gorillaz, Daniel Caesar, Juanes, and BadBadNotGood. A singer, songwriter, and producer, as well as a video director, Uchis truly arrived on her own with the self-released Por Vida (2015), an EP that led to a deal with Virgin EMI. By the time Uchis released her lively debut full-length, the Top Five Billboard R&B/hip-hop hit Isolation (2018), she had already been nominated for Grammy awards through her featured appearances on Daniel Caesar's “Get You” and Juanes' “El Ratico.”
